        "\n",
        "**Functions are objects in Python.** Therefore they have type, identity and values.Each function creates a new object with the name of the function. Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions.  \n",

        "There are some common errors that occur when working with functions  to be aware of. They include, copy, paste and not make the needed modifications when reusing code from one function in another.  Forgetting to return from a function is another common error. If you forget to return from a function, the function will return `None.`\n",

        "**Scope**\n",
        "\n",
        "Scope of a variable or function describes where in the program the variable or function is visible. Unless a variable is declared as global, the scope of a variable inside a function is limited to the function only. Declaring the variable as global, makes it visible inside the entire file. Global variables are prone to error and should be used sparingly.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Each scope has its own namespace, which is a dictionary for storing names and their values.  There are three nested scopes with their own namespaces, which makes it possible to have the same variable name in a local function and in a different scope, for example as a built-in name in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The three scopes are : built in scope, global scope and local scope. The process for searching for a name in these scopes, in the order of local, global and built in, is referred to scope resolution. If the event that the name is not found anywhere, a NameError is thrown.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "You can use the `locals()` and `globals()` functions to look at the respective name spaces.\n",

        "**Function arguments**\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python variables are passed by reference, meaning that you could potentially make a change to them that would affect them outside of the function.  Whether a function will actually modify a variable outside of itself depends on the type of object. If the object is immutable, the function will not change it. e.g. a string. If the object is mutable, e.g a list, the function will change it and affect other parts of the program.  \n",
        "\n",
        "It is possible to pass a mutable object  as a copy, so that it is not modified by the function. This requires the following syntax for a list \n",

        "Keyword arguments allow for passing parameters by name rather than by position. This can be helpful if the argument list is > 4.Default parameters are set when the function is defined and the value set will be used unless the calling function overrides it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another tool Python when working with arguments is the *args, which collects optional positional parameters. The **kwargs has the same purpose, but it stores a dictionary.\n",

        "\n",
        "Python can only return a single value, however, you can return multiple values by the use of a container, such as a tuple.  This allows for returning multiple values, separated by commas.\n",
