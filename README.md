## Evaluation
Will be based on  Weekly Coding Assignments and Participation Activities.

## Homework Assignments
Weekly homework assignments will be assigned to you on Canvas. Each assignment will be worth 100 points.  
Partial credit will be given for incomplete assignments turned in on time, based on the level of completion.
To receive full credit, your assignment must display the specified functionality and if specified, using specific techniques learned during class.
Late homework assignments may be accepted, with instructor permission, at 80% of total possible grade (80 points).  
Participation activities will be worth 20 points.

If you do not complete the assignment by the due date, you will receive a grade of 0. Partial points will be given for partially completed assignments. 

You may request a regrade at -20 points by emailing me and clearly stating for which assignment you are requesting a regrade (e.g. Email subject: Regrade  Ch 1 Code Lab: 1.14).  Late points for participation activities  -4 points.

A regrade request does not guarantee a regrade.


##  Email
Students can use email to communicate with me regarding private matters such as grades. However, questions that are content-related can benefit all students; therefore, please ask those either in the face-to-face environment or in our virtual course discussion forums. I will be checking forums daily and receive email notifications when students post. This helps speed up the response process along with the fact that your peers can also help answer your questions.
 
## Q&A Forum on Canvas
I have created a Q&A Forum in the Discussion section. 
If you have a question about the course or the content, please post it in this forum. If you see a question from a peer that you know the answer to, please feel free to answer it. This reduces the lag time between asking a question and getting an answer. Course questions should be posted here rather than being sent to my email so that all students benefit from the answer. Questions of a personal nature, such as feedback on an assignment, should be sent via the Inbox to protect your privacy.

## Academic Honesty
You will receive no credit and may be subject to disciplinary action if your graded work is determined not to be your own.  For more information, refer to your Academic Dishonesty Policy in the college catalog or student handbook.
