##Homework Assignments
Weekly homework assignments will be assigned to you via Canvas. Each assignment will be worth 100 points.  
Partial credit will be given for incomplete assignments turned in on time, based on the level of completion.
To receive full credit, your assignment should be displaying the specified functionality and if specified, using specific techniques learned during class.
Late homework assignments may be accepted at 80% of total possible grade (80 points).
Participation activities will be worth 20 points.


##Attendance (for in person classes)
While attendance and participation are not mandatory, they are highly recommended.  By attending and participating in class you will gain knowledge and exchange ideas and information with others.  In addition, completing the assignments will likely be more challenging without the information and discussions that take place in class. 


 ##Helping / Working with Others

I encourage you to work with other class members, which is how real life software is produced, however but you must hand in your own assignments. If found cheating you will receive no credit, and will be subject to college disciplinary action. For more information, refer to your Academic Dishonesty Policy in the college catalog or student handbook.

##Email
Students can use email to communicate with me regarding private matters such as grades. However, questions that are content-related can benefit all students; therefore, please ask those either in the face-to-face environment or in our virtual course discussion forums. I will be checking forums daily and receive email notifications when students post. This helps speed up the response process along with the fact that your peers can also help answer your questions.
 
##Q&A Forum
I have created a Q&A Forum in the Discussion section. 
If you have a question about the course or the content, please post it in this forum. If you see a question from a peer that you know the answer to, please feel free to answer it. This reduces the lag time between asking a question and getting an answer. Course questions should be posted here rather than being sent to my email so that all students benefit from the answer. Questions of a personal nature, such as feedback on an assignment, should be sent via the Inbox to protect your privacy.

##Academic Honesty
You will receive no credit and may be subject to disciplinary action if your graded work is determined not to be your own.  For more information, refer to your Academic Dishonesty Policy in the college catalog or student handbook.
